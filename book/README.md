# Running RStudio and Shiny on Google Cloud Platform

This project will walk you through setting up a Google Compute Engine VM  
and running encrypted versions of RStudio and Shiny on Google Cloud.

My attempt is to do most of the heavy lifting for you so you can get  
straight to the data analysis.
